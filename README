This is a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor library from Alexander Hinkel
http://www.arduino-projekte.de/index.php?n=63

This version comes with a step_noblock method that tries to
do the motor stepping in a non-blockin way.
Within the nolock step version the delay was removed and instead
we check at number of microseconds before doing the next step.

An additional example was added.
