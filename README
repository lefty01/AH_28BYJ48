This is a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor library from Alexander Hinkel
http://www.arduino-projekte.de/index.php?n=63

This version comes with a step_noblock method that tries to do the motor
stepping in a non-blocking way.
Within the noblock version of the step function the delay was removed and
instead we check at number of microseconds before doing the next step.

An additional example was added which demonstrates that two LEDs keep blinking
while the motor is rotating.
Note: take care of how much stuff you trying do in between the steps.
